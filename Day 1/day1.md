For Day 1, It will be Simple and Easy sentiment analysis. This project i have already done using LSTM. And here i did using Traditional Machine Learning models: Naive Bayes, SVM and Random Forest.
Since, I had already done this project, I suppose it will help me get started.
From Day 2, I will start with Deep learning and Neural Networks with pytorch.
